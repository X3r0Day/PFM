In profiles, we can add or remove the "steps". Like what scans will be done can be edited. (Order might not change cuz ofc
it needs a proper order to run the scans)


Where I left:

- I did decorators (basic logging things like log.suc(msg))
- Next, I added checkUrl.py which will check for the urls (completed)
- Now I have to make the enter target field more good looking.

What I need to do now:

- Make a python file which will check what profiles/tools are enabled by reading the profile.json
- Make scan.py complete.
